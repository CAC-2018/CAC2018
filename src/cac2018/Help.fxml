Basic Finance Simulator is a short game designed to spread awareness of personal finance and give students a view of some of the choices they will have to make as an adult. This game should give the player a basic idea of how to manage a monthly income as a working adult. In the game, the player, after creating a character, will be able to make monthly descisions on what to do with their money. These descisions give the player a means to spend their money to raise their well being, a number used to represent the player's general happiness. Generally, descisions that invole people, especially friends and family result in the most well being gain. To get started with the game and create a character, hit the Create Character button in the main menu." wrapText="true" />

While the professions themselves dont affect gameplay, their salaries do. When selecting a job, you can see the salary listed to the right. Next, you can pick between an apartment or a house. The choice is just one of player preference. WIth houses, the player has to pay mortgage (a monthly payment towards the house) and home insurance. With an apartment, the player just has to pay rent.  After selecting housing, the player can select the number of dependents they will provide for. A dependent is a person who lives under your income and does not bring in their own income. Examples of dependents can be children, significant others, elderly parents, etc. The number of dependents the player can choose to support is limited by their income. This is to avoid overspending. Be warned that for certain monthly descions during the game, costs will scale with number of dependents. Well being gains also scale with number of dependes, however, so choose wisely. Once you are ready to move on, hit Play." wrapText="true" />

Each month, the user will be able to click the Monthly Spending Descisions button in the bottom right corner. When they do so, a window will pop up asking about how the player wants to spend their money. Each month typically contains 12 questions. 10 of these questions appear every month, and 2 are unique to each month. Some of the 10 generic questions are repeats, because many of the spending descsions adults can make are over simple, everyday, common occurances. After answering these questions, the player can hit the next month button at the bottom of the window. The player's score, savings, and well being are shown in the center of the screen, salary infor is shown to the left, and fixed monthly costs are shown to the right. The player's score is determined on both savings and well being, so work on improving both. If at anytime, the player wants to look back on past descisions they can hit the View Spending History in the bottom left corner of the window.  Once you finish all of the questions in December, and you hit the next month button, you will be directed to a Game Complete screen. Good luck and spend wisely." wrapText="true" />
